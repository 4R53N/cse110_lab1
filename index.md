# Short Bio

I am a Computer Science student at University of California San Diego. In the past I have worked at UC San Diego IT Services 
and interned at startups like Herth.io and Instigate. Soon, I will be joining Amazon as an SDE Intern to put my knowledge and 
skills in use and learn from the best minds in the industry. In my free time I pursue my interests in Machine Learning and Math 
and develop full stack applications which allow me combine my love for design and logic.
